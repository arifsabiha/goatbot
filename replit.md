# Sabbir Chat Bot

A Facebook Messenger chat bot (based on the Goat-Bot V2 / Fca-Horizon-Remastered stack) by Md Ariful Islam Sabbir.

## How it runs on Replit

- **Runtime:** Node.js 20 (`nodejs-20` module)
- **Workflow / Start command:** `npm start` → `node Sabbir.js`
- **Web preview port:** `5000` (host `0.0.0.0`)
- **Deployment target:** Reserved VM (`vm`) — the bot must stay running 24/7 to keep its Messenger listener alive. Autoscale is not appropriate.

### Process layout

1. `Sabbir.js` (root entry, run by `npm start`)
   - Prints the banner.
   - Starts an Express **keep-alive web server on port 5000 / 0.0.0.0**, which is what the Replit preview iframe shows.
   - Spawns the actual bot (`sabbir.js`) as a **child process**.
   - If the child exits (for example because Facebook cookies expired and the bot called `process.exit()`), the wrapper logs the exit and **automatically restarts the child after 10 seconds**.
   - The keep-alive page (`/`) shows bot status, restart count, last exit code, and last exit time.
   - `/healthz` returns the same info as JSON.

2. `sabbir.js` (the actual bot)
   - Sets up `global.GoatBot`, `global.db`, `global.client`.
   - Calls `require('./utils/login.js')` which logs into Facebook using cookies in `account.txt` and starts the Messenger listener.
   - The duplicate Express server inside this file is gated behind `if (!process.env.BOT_NO_HTTP)`. The wrapper sets `BOT_NO_HTTP=1` so only the parent serves port 5000 (avoids `EADDRINUSE`).

## Required system / native dependencies

These were installed via Replit's package manager:

- `python3` — required at install time by `yt-dlp-exec`'s post-install script.
- `libuuid` — required at runtime by the `canvas` native module (`libuuid.so.1`).

`better-sqlite3` is consumed from the root `node_modules` (v9.x has a prebuilt binary for Node 20). The `sabbir-fca` subpackage's `require("better-sqlite3")` falls back to the parent `node_modules`.

## Configuration files

- `config.json` — bot settings (prefix, admin IDs, FCA options, dashboard, log events).
- `configCommands.json` — env / banned-command state (auto-managed).
- `account.txt` — Facebook appstate (cookies). **The cookies in this repo are expired**; the bot will print `Appstate Cookie Của Bạn Đã Bị Lỗi` and exit until fresh cookies are dropped in. The keep-alive web server stays up regardless.
- `FastConfigFca.json` — settings for the FCA library. `HTML.HTML` is set to `false` so the FCA does not try to bind its own server on port 80 (which is unavailable in this container and would conflict with port 5000 anyway).

## Bot is not connecting to Facebook

The keep-alive web server on port 5000 always stays up. The Messenger listener inside `sabbir-fca` will exit with `Appstate - Cookie Của Bạn Đã Bị Lỗi` until two things are both true:

1. `account.txt` contains fresh, non-revoked cookies for a logged-in Facebook session.
2. Facebook's HTML response for that session embeds a usable `fb_dtsg` token.

### Known upstream issue: empty `fb_dtsg` in HTML

As of 2026-04, Facebook ships `["DTSGInitData",[],{"token":"","async_get_token":""}]` in the initial HTML of every surface we tested (www / mbasic / m / web / business.facebook.com / messenger / accountscenter). The real token is now fetched async from inside the page's JavaScript runtime, which `request`-style scrapers cannot execute. The login chain in `sabbir-fca/Main.js` includes:

- A diagnostic block (`[FCA-DIAG]`) that prints the raw `DTSGInitData` snippet, any `name="fb_dtsg" value="..."` input, and `async_get_token` length so the failure mode is visible.
- A multi-URL probe (`[FCA-PROBE]`) that, when the homepage token is empty, tries 9 alternate Facebook surfaces with the FCA-authenticated cookie jar/headers to look for any URL that still embeds a real token.
- A regex fallback that, if everything above fails, accepts the LSD token (~27 chars) as `fb_dtsg`. Facebook rejects this for `getSeqId` and the FCA logs `ErrAppState`.

If a future Facebook change makes the token visible again on any single URL, the multi-URL probe will pick it up automatically — no further code changes needed.

If the empty-token behavior persists for the account in `account.txt`, the only realistic paths forward are:
- Run a real browser (Puppeteer / Playwright + headless Chromium) for the login step to execute the JS that fetches the token.
- Switch to Facebook's official Graph API with a Page Access Token (only works for Page-scoped messaging, not personal accounts).

These are larger architectural changes, not a quick patch.

### Headless-browser experiment (2026-04-26): appstate is server-side revoked

We added a Puppeteer-core + system Chromium fallback (`sabbir-fca/Extra/fetchFbDtsgBrowser.js`) wired into `Main.js` so a real browser could execute the page's JS and grab `fb_dtsg`. With proper cookie setup (URL anchor + `.facebook.com` domain + stealth patches for `navigator.webdriver` etc.), the browser **does** load with all 5 cookies in its jar:

```
[FCA-BROWSER] PRE-nav  page.cookies: [xs, fr, c_user, sb, datr]   ← all 5 set OK
[FCA-BROWSER] post-nav page.cookies: [fr, sb, datr]               ← FB cleared c_user + xs
[FCA-BROWSER] post-nav url=https://www.facebook.com/ bodyChars=482 loginForm=true
```

Facebook's first response includes a `Set-Cookie` that explicitly **deletes `c_user` and `xs`** (the only cookies that prove identity). The page that gets rendered is the public login form, not the homepage. This is the definitive Facebook signal for "your session has been revoked" — it cannot be worked around with code. The cookies in `account.txt` are dead.

To bring the bot online, replace `account.txt` with a fresh appstate exported right after a successful Chrome login (e.g. via the C3C-FBState browser extension, or any tool that exports `document.cookie` + `httpOnly` cookies for `*.facebook.com`). The headless-browser fallback remains wired in: when a fresh, server-side-valid appstate is supplied, it should now succeed at fetching the live `fb_dtsg`.

### FCA group-routing fix (2026-04-26): "1545012 not part of conversation"

**Symptom**: Bot logs in fine, MQTT connects, message events flow from every group, but `message.reply` only delivers in **one** group chat. All other groups produce `WARN sendMessage Got error 1545012. This might mean that you're not part of the conversation <gcID>`.

**Root cause** in `sabbir-fca/src/sendMessage.js` `send()` function: the routing decision was based on a string-length heuristic written for legacy 9–10-digit Messenger IDs. For new "61xxxxxxxxxxxxx" Facebook accounts, *both* user IDs and group IDs are 15 digits, so the heuristic always took the user branch:

```js
if (THREADFIX.length <= 15 || global.Fca.isUser.includes(threadID))
    sendContent(form, threadID, !isGroup, ...);   // ← isGroup=null here, so isSingleUser=true
```

That made FCA send `specific_to_list[0]=fbid:<gcID>` + `other_user_fbid=<gcID>` (a 1-on-1 payload) to a group thread, which Facebook rejects with error 1545012. The "one GC that worked" was a thread already cached in `global.Fca.isThread` from an earlier session.

**Fix** (two files):

1. `sabbir-fca/src/listenMqtt.js` — in the NewMessage path *and* the deltaMessageReply path, push every received `threadID` into the appropriate cache (`global.Fca.isThread` if `isGroup`, else `global.Fca.isUser`). This is the authoritative source: `messageMetadata.threadKey.threadFbId` is set for groups, `otherUserFbId` for 1-on-1.

2. `sabbir-fca/src/sendMessage.js` — replaced the broken `send()` routing with cache-first lookup:
   - explicit `isGroup` arg wins,
   - then `global.Fca.isUser` / `global.Fca.isThread` cache,
   - then live event in `global.Fca.Data.event.get("Data")` (matched by threadID),
   - default to **group** routing so unsolicited sends to fresh threads don't misroute as 1-on-1 (the original bug).

The cache is now populated on every received message, so by the time the bot replies, `isSingleUser` is decided correctly for both inbox and any group.

### FCA autoseen fix (2026-04-26)

`scripts/cmds/autoseen.js` calls `api.markAsRead(threadID, true)`. The MQTT-only branch in `sabbir-fca/src/markAsRead.js` silently dropped requests when `ctx.mqttClient` was momentarily unavailable (during reconnect). Patched to fall back to the legacy HTTP `mercury/change_read_status.php` endpoint when the MQTT publish fails, and to actually call `callback()` on the MQTT success path so the surrounding promise resolves.
